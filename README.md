Briefly, to generate a new token, go to your GitHub settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Generate.

If somehow submitAnalysis() didnâ€™t allow you to upload the results to Phase2.1ardsRSummariesPublic, you can share the results file with  @bertrandmoal via the #ards_young Slack channel.
